# invoices-manager-react
React Academy invoices manager made in react with vite.

Use npm run json-server to start the server and npm run dev to start the client. Visit localhost:5173 to see the application running.

## Goal

- Implement the "Discard changes" functionality
- Implement error messages for each field
- Make the title field not only required, but with a minimum length of 3 characters.
- As an exercise, remove all the HTML validation attributes (required, minlength...) and instead keep the validity of the form in a state.
- Make sure the user cannot leave an invoice with unsaved changes unless they confirm.
